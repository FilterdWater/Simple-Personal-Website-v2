# 👋 Hello!

My name is Lars, something you’ve probably already figured out. I’m a student at Technova College, where I’m primarily studying web development.

## In My Free Time, I Enjoy

- **Working Out**  
  Staying active and healthy is important to me, so I spend a lot of time at the gym or just moving around in general.

- **Watching YouTube**  
  I love watching creators produce long-form videos about topics they’re passionate about.

- **Programming**  
  I enjoy creating things, exploring new technologies, and challenging myself with complex problems. It’s both a creative outlet and a way to keep my problem-solving skills sharp.

## Random Things

- **I Pay for Email**  
  Specifically, I use [ProtonMail](https://proton.me/mail).

- **I Often use FOSS**  
  I like using Linux, referred to as [GNU/Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU/Linux_naming_controversy) by some, and [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/).

- **I Can Vibrate My Eyes**  
  Although I often tend to forget I can.
