Haven’t posted in a while, so I figured, why not? Every now and then I remember my website exists and end up re-reading an old post, like **My 2024 Setup**. It’s always interesting to see how much has changed since then, especially when I thought it wouldn’t. For example, I’m not using Fedora KDE Plasma as my daily driver anymore, though it’s still a solid distro.

Lately, I’ve been going through a simple Python course by [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez). I’d never touched Python before, but I wanted to see why its so popular. Alongside that, I’m still picking away at learning Docker and containers here and there.

At some point, I also want to dive into C and eventually Rust. I haven’t worked with low-level languages before, but C/C++ is practically everywhere, and I have a feeling Rust will be just as common in the future.

I’ve also been jotting down a few project ideas for when the mood strikes. The first one that comes to mind:

- **Tauri Timer:** a cross-platform desktop alternative to [Pomofocus](https://pomofocus.io/)

I’ve been using Pomofocus and it works fine, but I like the idea of building an offline, FOSS, cross-platform desktop version using Tauri.

Anyway, this post isn’t meant to be anything huge, just felt like writing something again and putting it out there.
