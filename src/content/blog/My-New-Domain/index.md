I've acquired a new domain, but why?

Up until now, my projects have been hosted using Strato.nl's services. That setup worked fine, but I wanted more control and flexibility. I also wanted an excuse to try out [Coolify](https://coolify.io/).

So, I bought a new domain, picked up a VPS from Hetzner, installed Coolify on it, and now [larsvanholland.dev](https://larsvanholland.dev/) is live!

Coolify comes with a bunch of nice features. If you're curious, check out their [docs](https://coolify.io/docs/get-started/introduction) to learn more.

## What is Coolify?

Coolify is an open-source, self-hostable Heroku / Netlify / Vercel alternative that makes it easy to deploy and manage your own applications, databases, and services, on your own servers.

Hereâ€™s some of what it can do:

- **Git-based deployments**: Connect a GitHub or GitLab repo. Coolify can build and deploy it automatically.
- **Docker support**: It uses Docker under the hood, so you can deploy pretty much anything.
- **Built-in reverse proxy**: Automatically provisions HTTPS certificates using Traefik, no need to mess with nginx or Let's Encrypt manually.
- **Simple UI**: A clean dashboard for managing apps, logs, environment variables, and more.

## Wrapping up

I hope using Coolify will help me learn more about self-hosting, servers, Docker, and other cool technologies as I move my stuff away from Strato.

So, for a probably more up to date version of this website, go to the .dev domain version instead :-)
