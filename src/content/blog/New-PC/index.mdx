This is a short post about my new PC build and my first time making an animation in Blender.

## Specs

Here’s the list of components I used for the build:

> **Note:** I didn’t actually need to buy thermal paste since some came with the CPU cooler. RIP €12.90—though, considering I had to metaphorically sell a kidney for the rest, the thermal paste waste didn't feel too bad.

## Building the PC

I built this PC primarily as a workstation rather than a gaming PC. The plan was to avoid frequent upgrades, much like my previous build. This was also my first time building a PC myself! Huge thanks to [PCPartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/) and LTT's ["How to Build a PC, the Last Guide You’ll Ever Need!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1fxZ-VWs2U) for making the process manageable.

### Pictures

Here are some snapshots from the build process:

## Current Setup

I’m currently running Windows 11 on this system. At the time of writing this, the drivers in the RPM Fusion repository don’t work with Wayland and KDE Plasma 6 for some users with newer NVIDIA GPUs. For now, I’ve chosen to use Windows with WSL until a better Linux solution becomes viable.

## Blender Animation

Here’s an animation I made by following [this tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0J27sf9N1Y&list=PLjEaoINr3zgEPv5y--4MKpciLaoQYZB1Z) by [Blender Guru](https://www.youtube.com/@blenderguru):

<video width="auto" height="auto" controls>
  <source src={video3} type="video/mp4" />
  If you see this message, your browser does not support the video tag.

Even with my PC, it took around an hour and a half to render this animation.

So yeah, that’s basically it! I just wanted to write a short blog post about the build since it’s my first time building a PC.

On top of that, I also upgraded the website to Astro 5. From what I can tell, it won’t have a significant impact, but it’s nice to stay updated.
