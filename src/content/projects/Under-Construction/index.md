As of May 26th, I've decided to cancel my subscription to [Strato's](https://www.strato.nl/) services, since I now self-host using [Coolify](https://coolify.io/). All of my school projects were hosted on Strato, so they‚Äôll be gone from their servers soon, not that they were particularly impressive anyway.

For now, things are a bit empty around here. I _could_ self-host my old projects, but honestly, I don't feel like dealing with projects I don't care about anymore just for the sake of keeping this projects page from looking less empty.

Eventually, once I finish a new personal or school project, it'll show up here. For now, though, it‚Äôs a bit empty. üóøüëç
